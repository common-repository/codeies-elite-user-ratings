Elite User ratings allows your visitors to submit user reviews with a 1-5 star rating on your website

== Description ==

Elite User ratings allows your visitors to submit user reviews with a 1-5 star rating on your website, similar to the way you would on TripAdvisor or Yelp. The plugin provides blocks, shortcodes, and widgets, along with full documentation.

You can pin your best reviews so that they are always shown first, require approval before new review submissions are published, require visitors to be logged-in in order to write a review, send custom notifications on a new submission, and a lot more!
